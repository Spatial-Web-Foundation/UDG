# UDG Design Specification

The Universal Domain Graph (UDG) is a medium for collective intelligence in the Spatial Web. This specification defines how the UDG supports collective intelligence and other functions through a set of conceptual designs.  Requirements arising from the designs are identified as applicable to the Spatial Web components. By this functional analysis, design synthesis and component requirements, this specification contributes to the overal engineering of the Spatial Web.

The **Universal Domain Graph(UDG) design Specification** defines functions performed by the UDG, present analyses of those functions, and records the allocation of requirements to the Spatial Web components including HSML, HSTP, and several Spatial Web Nodes.  

The purpose of this specification is to define a design of the Spatial Web UDG. The UDG design defines requirements for the Spatial Web implementation specifications and guides domain-specific Spatial Web architecture development.

The UDG Design Specification fulfills compliance requirements of *IEEE P2874 Standard for Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture, and Governance*

The document is structured as an architecture description consistent with the approach defined in <<ISO_IEC_IEEE_42010_2022, System architecture description>>. 

This document provides these architecture views that define the UDG system design:
* Enterprise viewpoint
* UDG as a knowledge graph
* UDG and hyperspace
* UDG as a network of registries
* UDG as a social network
* UDG Distributed Computing
