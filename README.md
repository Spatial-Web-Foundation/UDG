# Universal Domain Graph (UDG)

## Purpose of this document

This repo provides the design philosophy, architecture, and registry information for the Universal Domain Graph (UDG) system of the Spatial Web. Much of this content is informative rather than normative, describing high level principles about how the UDG works and how to participate in it, with more specific technical information available within other specifications.

At this time and until further notice, only SWF employees and advisors can access this repository. All contents are SWF copyright.

## From World Wide Web to Spatial Web

In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the concept of the World Wide Web, primarily as a means to publish documents in a distributed fashion without being reluctant upon dedicated (and usually commercial) content management systems. It's fundamental notion was that you could imagine an information space (like a large library) where each book in the library had a specific address, which then allowed you to retrieve its content over the web. This model was strengthened through the use of hypertext links, where clicking or interacting with such a link would take you to a new addess that could be used to retrieve a new "page".

This model would become wildly popular and ultimately ubiquitous, but as it developed, the core metaphors involved became increasingly leaky and strained. It was set up primarily as a way to send documents, but even as the definition of document became stretched it reached a point where the web of documents disappeared into a sea of machine generated code with a huge amount of javascript holding it together.
