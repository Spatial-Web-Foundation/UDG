# Entities

An **entity** is the fundamental class within the UDG for describing the various things, agents, and places that make up the Spatial Web. Every structure, building, planet, character (agent), animal, mystical alien pyramid or similar construct, is ultimately an entity, and is addressable within the context of the spatial web.

An entity exists within the context of a [Domain](Domain.md).
