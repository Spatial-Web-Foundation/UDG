= Spatial Web Hyperspace

== Classes of hypespace

The concept of hyperspace is fundamental for the Spatial Web and an organizing method for entities in the UDG. To support this fundamental role, clause 6.2 of IEEE P2874 provides a formal definition of hyperspace, as any set whose elements are related by a formal notion of _path_.  The basic classes of hyperspace include: Graphs including Cellular spaces and Vector spaces with coordinate systems.

<<IEEE_2874_2025, Spatial Web Protocol Architecture and Governance>> defines the following hyperspace concepts

* Classes of hyperspace: graphs, vector spaces, hypergraphs, abstract data types.  
* Hyperspaces of spaces: where a point of a space is a space of the corresponding type
* Cellular spaces: in which cells of a chosen type are connected according to a schema.
* Geographic spaces: locations relative to the Earth
* Time in hyperspace: as a dimension, as a duration, as a trajectory 
* Structures: origin, dimension, metric, similarity, norm and inner product
* Operations: products, sums, subspaces
* Connecting spaces: points in common to multiple subspaces, i.e., Portal.


== Attributes associated with hyperspace

Location identifies a specific place in a hyperspace.
Location in hyperspace can be of several types: cell address, coordinate 
location in HSML:  graph:Node, cell identifier, coordinates as well-known-text, tensor 

Geometries
Entities have a hyperspace:spatialProperty (e.g., geo:hasGeometry, hspace:cell) to point to the actual value.
