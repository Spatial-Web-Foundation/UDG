= Analysis Summary

* **Total Use*: 30
* **Total Requirements Mapped**: 209 IEEE P2874 requirements analyzed
* **Primary Coverage Areas**:
** Entity and domain management (UDG, DSA, HSML)
** Agent intelligence and interaction (AIS)
** Communication and protocols (HSTP)
** System governance and scaling (SWG)

== Key Observations

. **Most comprehensive coverage** is in core UDG operations like entity querying, state management, and distributed operations
. **Agent-related use cases** map well to AIS requirements focusing on intelligent agent behaviors
. **Infrastructure use cases** (setup, scaling, failover) align with DSA and SWG requirements
. **Communication use cases** (channels, state subscription) correspond to HSTP protocol requirements
. **Some use cases have multiple requirement matches**, indicating complex functionality that spans multiple system areas

NOTE: This correlation is based on functional analysis of requirement
descriptions and use case content. Some requirements may support multiple use
cases, and some use cases may require coordination across multiple requirement
areas.
