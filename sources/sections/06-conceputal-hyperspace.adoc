== UDG and hyperspace

=== Spatial Web Hyperspace

The concept of hyperspace is fundamental for the Spatial Web and an organizing
method for entities in the UDG. To support this fundamental role, clause 6.2 of
IEEE P2874 provides a formal definition of hyperspace, as any set whose elements
are related by a formal notion of _path_.  The basic classes of hyperspace
include: Graphs including Cellular spaces and Vector spaces with coordinate
systems.

Geographic space can be modelled as a particular kind of cellular space, called
a _Discrete Global Grid System_ (DGGS), which typically models both
three-dimensional physical space plus one time dimension. DGGSs therefore
provide the Spatial Web with an approach for embedding geographic space into
cellular or graphy hyperspace. The figure below illustrates a framework for the
coordination of geographic DGGS and CRS with Spatial Web hyperspace.

Use of DGGS allows geographic Domains to be embedded as graphs in the Spatial
Web UDG which is also a graph space.

=== Spatial embedding of Spatial Web entities

The Spatial Web defines space as hyperspace in order to represent many entity
properties using a spatial embedding approach.   Spatial embedding: mathematical
methods for representing data in a continuous, multi-dimensional vector space.
Spatial embedding was a key technology to the recent advances in LLM AI, see for
example, Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their
Compositionality, Mikolov, et.al. NIPS-2013

LLMs use spatial embedding for linguistic concepts, encoding words as vectors,
also called  Word2Vec.  The Spatial Web uses spatial embedding for the Spatial
Web ENTITIES.  One inspiration for this approach is World2Vec.   World2Vec was
an internal name for a project led by
https://x.com/ylecun/status/1523018860731023361[Yann LeCunn]

Recent research has shown that features in LLM spatial embeddings may have universal applicability.

"Representing Features in Hyperspace Geography; Extracting Interpretable
Features" is a study by
https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/[Anthropic]. They
found a diversity of highly abstract features in Claude 3. Examples of features
they found include features for famous people, features for countries and
cities. Many features are multilingual (responding to the same concept across
languages) and multimodal (responding to the same concept in both text and
images), as well as encompassing both abstract and concrete instantiations of
the same idea.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07987["The Platonic Representation Hypothesis", Huh, et.al. 2024],
observes that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are
converging. Different neural networks representations are becoming more aligned.
Convergence is occurring across modalities: vision models and language. This
convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to
Plato's concept of an ideal reality.


=== Indexing Spatial Web graph entities using hyperspace embedding

The UDG KG contains a graph of Spatial Web Entities.  Spatial embedding of the
world, e.g., World2Vec, results in generalized features in hypespace.

Development is needed along the lines of linking UDG KG entities with features
in Coordinate Hyperspace.

This ability to go between graph and coordinate domains may provide a basis for
semantic interoperabilty.

=== Hyperspace Entity Locators (HELs)

Vector emdedding occurs in a vector space.  Vector spaces are indexed using
coordinate systems.  The coordinates are the index. Here a vector may have up to
1024 dimensions.

Geogrpahic space is indexed by Coordinate Reference Systems.  A CRS includes
both a Coordinate System (CS) and a Datum.  The CS provides the dimensions and
units.  The Datum anchors the abstract CS to the physical world.  Typically a
Datum includes a benchmark plate at a specific location to which coordinates are
assigned.  The assigned coordinates for that location allow for transformation
to a CRS with a different datum.  (See ISO 19111, Referencing by coordinates)

A coordinate set such as latitude and longitude is ambigous unless a datum is
specified.  The GPS positioning system led to the most widely used family of
datums known as WGS-84.

By analogy, investigation is needed to determine if Hyperspace Reference System
(HRSs) can be defined for hyperspace coordinates systems using for Spatial Web
embedding.  CS systems for spatial embedding already exist.  Datums for Spatial
Web hyperspace HRSs are needed. The datums most likely will be based on
real-world semantics.  Real-world semantic datums may allow for transformation
between HRSs based on differing semantic datums.

With HRSs based on semantic datums defined, Hyperspace Entity Locators (HELs)
can be defined. Much like URLs locate based on hypertext, HELs would location an
ENTITY ased on an HRS.  HELs would locate ENTITIES in hyperspace.

With HRS and HEL defined, the ability to go from the UDG KG to Hyperspace can be
done.  ENTITIES in UDG KG would include an HEL to located it in hyperspace.
Thereby providing every KG ENTITY a locating in an HRS; and the locations could
be converted between HRSs.

It would be important to define HRS that are useful across many DOMAINS.

=== UDG size estimate

==== Summary Estimate

How big is the UDG?  Estimates of the UDG size are given below.  Here is a summary:

* UDG is a hypergraph which contains all relationships between all known SWIDs in the Spatial Web.
* How many SWIDs might there be in the Spatial Web: ~1014
** Current large knowledge graphs (Microsoft): is on the order of 10**12 entities
** Wikipedia is 6*10**7
** Embedding H3 DGGS into UDG that would be 10**14 hexagons
* Query performance
** H3 grid/hash queries by Databricks
** Geographic query bigger than a set of buildings in the US is too big. 2.5*10**8

==== Existing large knowledge graphs

The UDG is similar to existing, proprietary knowledge graphs.

https://cacm.acm.org/practice/industry-scale-knowledge-graphs/[Industry-Scale Knowledge Graphs in ACM Communications 2019]
provides a summary of large existing knowledge graphs.  These knowledge graphs
may have grown a handful of orders of magnitude since 2019 when the size of each
was:

* Microsoftâ€™s knowledge graph:  ~2 billion primary entities,  2*10**9 entities as of 2019.
* 2023 estimate of large knowledge graphs 10**12 entities


As of September 2025, the contents of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia[Wikipedia] were:

* English articles 7,063,252 (roughly 7*10**7)
* Total wiki pages: 64,128,394



==== Geographic H3 index

The H3 geospatial indexing system is a discrete global grid system (see Sahr et
al., 2003) consisting of a multi-precision hexagonal tiling of the sphere with
hierarchical indexes.   H3 was developed to address the challenges of Uber's
data science needs. H3 is now open source under the Apache 2 license.

H3 is a hierarchical geospatial index. Hexagonal cells at level 12 have an area
of 90 dm2 and there are 5.7*10**14 hexagons


==== VERSES estimate of the Spatial Web

* 2.4 trillion objects on the Earth.  2.4*10**12
* 9.9 sextillion connections on the internet 9.9*10**21
* 2.9 septillion connections on the spatial web 2.9*10**24
* Square root of a septillion = ~10**12

== Domain as a map

A DOMAIN is a model. It provides context for the things within the model, and also describes a purpose for that model. It is, in a very real sense, a __map__, albeit one that is self-aware and changes dynamically over time, though the question about what a domain is a map ___of___ is something that is dependent upon the author or model maker.

Something that is central to the spatial web is that it is __not__ necessarily a reflection of reality. As with any map, a domain is an abstraction of a (typically physical) space and the entities that evolve within that space over time. For instance, one can create a domain showing the London subway system:

image::_116112246_064832377.jpg[London Subway System 2025]

The domain can even be seen as a representation showing where the individual trains are within that subway system (to a close approximation). Note that such a map is not necessarily spatially correct - it shows routes and stations, but these are not positionally correct. In this case, what you are looking at is a topological construct, simplified to show what is relevant, not necessarily what is a detailed reflection of the subway on (or in this case under) the ground.

To that end, designing a domain typically comes down to answering a number of questions:

* __What is this a map of?__ Most maps show things of significance within a given context. Why is the map being created? what is it's purpose? Just as a document exists in the world wide web to inform, entertain, record, and persuade, a domain exists in the spatial web for much the same thing.
* __Does the map change over time?__ Until recently, all maps were effectively just snapshots in time, and it has only been comparatively recently that we could create maps that capture evolution of a system over time.
* __Does the map reflect changes in the real world?__ This is a more subtle question, but an important one. Is there some form of feedback between a physical array of sensors and cameras that drive the evolution of the model, or is the driving factor in the map some form of algorithm or AI (a simulation).
* __Can changes to the map cause changes in the real world?__ Put another way, if a user of the map indicates a change be made to some entity within that map, will that change be reflected in the real world system that the map is a reflection of? Is it interactive?
* __Is the map participatory?__ Are there other agents that can change the state of the map (whether it reflects physical reality or not) and how do they interact with that map? How are changes in the map expressed back to the user.
* __Is the map linked to other maps?__ Does the map describe a comprehensive system, or is it possible to change to a different map based upon linking, tiling or similar system?
* __Does the map have multiple levels of detail (LOD)?__ Can you zoom in on an area to get more detail? Do you need to provide metadata (text and image content)? Is it dynamic?
* __Does the map have persistance?__ When an agent enters the map, will that map reflect changes made to it by others (an environment), or are changes lost between sessions (typical of tours)?
* __Who or what is the intended audience of the map?__ Is this used primarily by humans or by automated systems?

The role of the Spatial Web system is to deliver these different kinds of maps, to make them integrated and useful across a wide variety of applications. Just as the world wide web exploded the concept of a library - a collection of documents - into a world-wide phenomenon, so too does the creation of domains enable the same thing for maps as a way of perceiving and understanding the worlds, both real and imagined, around us.
