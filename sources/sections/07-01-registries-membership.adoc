= Spatial Web registries

== Domain membership, identity and registries

Registries in the Spatial Web are of two types, performing two distinct functions:

* A Domain Registry is used to record the membership of an ENTITY in a DOMAIN.  (See <<domain_membership>> )
* A Verifiable Data Registry (VDR) provides the information for a SWID document.  (VDR is as defined in <<w3c_did>>)

The two functions for Spatial Web registries are distinct, i.e., a Domain registry is not the source of SWIDs.  

Because DOMAINS may be members of multiple upper domains, and DOMAINS may move between upper domains; DOMAIN identity may proceed registration.

Registration of a DOMAIN in an upper DOMAIN results in the membership being recorded in the Registry and a credential being issued to the registered ENTITY.

The Spatial Web registries follow these design goals and properties:

* All ENTITIES (including CREDENTIALS) have SWIDs.
* Uniqueness of SWIDs using the did:swid method is ensured by a VDR.  The VDR may be part of the Spatial Web Registry operated by the SWA or in a VDR separate from the Spatial Web Registry
* SWIDs may be created by a DID Issuer at behest of the ENTITY and not recorded in a centralized registry.
o The Spatial Web will include ENTITIES with DIDs created without interaction with any particular authority.

These properties are elaborated in the Spatial Web Identifiers (SWIDs) and SWID Documents Implementation Specification (SWF STD-4:2025) and the DID Method for the Spatial Web (did:swid) Implementation Specification (SWF STD-5:2025).

== Spatial Web Registry

The Spatial Web Registry contains both a Domain Registry for Top and Public DOMAIN registration and a VDR associated with issuing SWIDs using the did:swid method.  The Spatial Web Registry is managed by the Spatial Web Registration Authority.

EDITOR: In IEEE 2874-2025, SWA is the acronym used for the Spatial Web Registration Authority.  In this document, both SWA and SWRA are used for the Spatial Web Registration Authority, but SWRA is preferred.

The composite Spatial Web registry process is in two parts: SWID creation; Domain registration.  Each part is shown in a figure.

* A registrant request to create a SWID for an ENTITY using the Spatial Web Registry; The Registry responds with a SWID created using the did:swid method
* A registrant request to add the ENTITY as a member of a DOMAIN; The Registry responds with a credential

== Governance

The Spatial Web Registration Authority (SWRA or SWA) is the organization which administers the Spatial Web Registry.  The SWRA may designate one more entities to manage the creation of SWIDs and registry of Domain membership. The SWA, on behalf of the public, shall establish general rules for changes to the UDG, such as Domain Authority, allowable Domain names, Domain claim dispute resolution, cost of registration, and restrictions on the addition or deletion of names.

== User functions

The Spatial Web Registry shall provide user facing functions including:

* Resolving SWIDs
* Disclosure of ENITITIES registered as members of a DOMAIN
