== Enterprise view of the UDG

UDG in IEEE 2874

Universal Domain Graph (UDG) is the distributed hypergraph which contains all relationships between all known SWIDs in the Spatial Web. Syn: UDG. The universal domain graph is the complete Spatial Web hypergraph.

The Distributed UDG System: is the set of coordinated Spatial Web Nodes that provide services on the distributed UDG. Syn: distributed UDG system.

A Spatial Web Node is a computing machine connected to the internet, capable of exchanging HSTP messages.


What kind of graph is the UDG?

Technologies for graphs that are relevant to the UDG. 

* System thinking: parts/wholes, autopoietic 
* Networks: distance, neighbor, connectedness, degrees, FOAF, dynamics 
* Semantics: subject-predicate-object triples, RDF 
* Property graph: attributed graphs for cyber-physical entities 
* Tesselation and index of the physical world; DGGS 
* Factor graphs: message passing 
* Ecosystems: competition and collective resources, multilevel evolutionary dynamics 
* Social: Network Epistemology, collective intelligence 
  
    
UDG Concepts from the Spatial Web architecture spec (P2874). 

* A Graph in the Spatial Web is a set of nodes along with a set of edges, such that every edge has a source note and a target node. (6.2.2.1.) 
* The Universal Domain Graph (UDG) is a graph serving as key infrastructure of the Spatial Web (6.3.5.1.) 
  * The UDG graph allows for nested, hierarchical and heterarchical groupings 
  * The UDG graph maintains intra-relational and inter-relational domain coherence 
  * The UDG is a hypergraph containing all relationships between all known SWIDs in the Spatial Web. 
  * The UDG is composed of nodes and links where the nodes are ENTITIES and the links are relations between the ENTITIES.
  
How will UDG be used 
  
* Agent updating its factor graph 
* Finding friends and situations 
* Looking for patterns in UDG - Platonic paper 
* Collective intelligence

UDG as a graph of entities vs. UDG as a ditsributed computing nodes 

The UDG Conceptual structure is distributed across SW computing nodes. There is a non-isomorphic relationship between the Conceptual domain hierarchies and the SW Nodes. Presence of a Domain in a a specific SW node may be dynamic and transient. SW Registries are hosted by UDG nodes.
