== Stakeholder Needs and System Requirements

- UDG in IEEE 2874
- Objectives
- UDG as types of network
		- Technologies for graphs that are relevant to the UDG.
			- System thinking: parts/wholes, autopoietic
			- Networks: distance, neighbor, connectedness, degrees, FOAF, dynamics
			- Semantics: subject-predicate-object triples, RDF
			- Property graph: attributed graphs for cyber-physical entities
			- Tesselation and index of the physical world; DGGS
			- Factor graphs: message passing
			- Ecosystems: competition and collective resources, multilevel evolutionary dynamics
			- Social: Network Epistemology, collective intelligence
		- The UDG study is to develop a survey of graph technologies in order to recommend design approaches that best fit the Spatial Web UDG concepts.
			- UDG Study steps:
				1. Compile a survey of technologies
				2. Develop design concepts
				3. Evaluate the candidate designs
		- UDG Concepts from the  Spatial Web architecture spec (P2874).
			- A Graph in the Spatial Web is a set of nodes along with a set of edges, such that every edge has a source note and a target node. (6.2.2.1.)
			- The Universal Domain Graph (UDG) is a graph serving as key infrastructure of the Spatial Web (6.3.5.1.) 
				- The UDG graph allows for nested, hierarchical and heterarchical groupings
				- The UDG graph maintains intra-relational and inter-relational domain coherence
				- The UDG is a hypergraph containing all relationships between all known SWIDs in the Spatial Web.
				- The UDG is composed of nodes and links where the nodes are ENTITIES and the links are relations between the ENTITIES.
		- How will UDG be used
			- Agent updating its factor graph
			- Finding friends and situations
			- Looking for patterns in UDG - Platonic paper
			- (Statement from Kurts kickoff ppt late slide)
			- Collective intelligence

- UDG as a graph of entities vs. UDG as a ditsributed computing nodes
	- The UDG Conceptual structure is distributed across SW computing nodes. There is a non-isomorphic relationship between the Conceptual domain hierarchies and the SW Nodes. Presence of a Domain in a a specific SW node may be dynamic and transient. SW Registries are hosted by UDG nodes.
