== General

In the Spatial Web, places, not surprisingly have the position of prominance. It is defined as follows:

____
A __place__ within a domain is a *__unique__*, *__addressable__* state from the
set of all possible states (a *__hyperspace__*) for that domain.
____

The definition of a place may sound rather formal and non-intuitive, but it comes about because of the mandate concerning the role of the spatial web as a way of describing both physical and conceptual spaces.

____
A place is __unique__ within a given domain if there are no other domains which
have the same hyperspace configuration.
____

____
A place is __addressable__ within a given domain if there is a specific set of
keys or identifiers that collectively are also unique within that domain.
____

____
A __hyperspace__ consists of the set of all valid places within a domain.
____

To make this definition clearer, consider a domain that represents a game (an
instance) of _chess_. There are 66 potential _places_ where a given piece can be
located - the 64 squares that make up an 8x8 chessboard, and two cache areas,
one for each player, where pieces that are removed are located.

image::SCD_algebraic_notation.svg[Chess Board, using algebraic notation and the initial starting position for the black pieces]

This link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_%28chess%29[board nomenclature] is considered canonical by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE[FIDE, the International Chess Federation].

Each of these places has a distinct identifier that makes up its address, and,
within the scope of a particular game of chess, is considered unique. Note that
the places here are not globally unique - the same position may be used across
multiple games across multiple servers - but within the context of its domain,
it IS unique.

We can also make up notations for each of the two caches - White Cache (WC) and
Black Cache (BC) for pieces that are outside the formal scope of the board but
nonetheless represent the location of a specific piece (agent). If I move the
White Queen (WQ) to e4, then that agent is now located in the place 4 units up
from the White queen's side of the board and five units (e) from the left edge
of the board.

It is worth noting that the hyperspace here is ONLY these particular squares (or
caches). You cannot go to position j17, because such a position, while
plausable, does not exist within the set of all permissible places in the
hyperspace.

It is also worth noting that movement from place to place within a domain does
not have to follow contiguity rules. The knight in particular is very
constrained in where it can go (if the knight is on e4, than it can go to d6,
f6, c3, c5, g3, g5, d2 or f2, but it cannot go to d4 or f4, which are contiguous
to it ), but can also move over other pieces so long as the target place is not
occupied by a piece of their own color.

This is worth reiterating - a spatial web domain is not a perfect reproduction
of the real world. The knight cannot move within its square (place) in this
particular domain (though a representation could move within that square, it's
not something that is considered in the model).

To extend this, you can consider a hexagonal tiling of a space, as may be
considered by a table top war game. The addressing in this space is more
complex, because each hexagon has a particular index (address) that can be
derived from some particular algorithm. The link:https://h3geo.org[H3 System]
system used by Uber is an illustration of such a tiling system on a sphere.

image::st_hexagongrid01.png[Hexagonal tiling]

A place can also be defined in terms of an array of such tiling indices. These
can in turn be hashed in some fashion to am irregular polygon. For instance, in
the game of Risk, you can create such polygon that describe each of the
"countries" in the game. Note that what is important in Risk is the movement
from country (say Kamchatka) to country (Alaska).

In this particular map, the specific boundaries or definitions as geometries are
less important than the underlying topology of the map (shown here specifically
for North America)

This notion of identifying the places within a domain is useful in a number of
ways because it forces thinking in terms of topology, rather than geography.
There are ways of specifying the extents of particular place entities from a
rendering standpoint (typically as sheets of polygons) but in most domains,
dealing with the conceptual representation of a place is often far more
important than dealing with a precise geographical distribution.

In a topological view, places are connected via internal links (roughly
analogous to the hypertext anchors or __&lt;a href="#foo"&gt;__ tags) to local
links __&lt;a name="foo"&gt;__. These represent permissible states that a given
agent can move to from a given place, absent any other constraining information.
For instance, from Ontario, one can go to the Eastern or Western United States,
Greenland, Quebec or Alberta, but you cannot go to Central America or Iceland
directly without passing through an intervening country.

Note that such a topological view also illustrates why places are entities. In
this mode, a place is an entity that has some form of interaction. A place can
be a hyperlink to another domain. For instance, one can imaging a scaled up
version of Risk where different regions within the Ontario "country" have their
own version of Risk. The game may be a subgame (a subdomain) of the current
game, but the places involved are different.

This is a critical distinction between place and domain. The domain contains all
of the potential place objects within a graph, but each place object may include
a link to a domain that shows a deeper level of resolution. This is a pattern
that occurs all the time, and is again illustrative of one of the central adages
of the Spatial Web:

This topological equivalency comes into play whenever there is a need to talk
about routes, legs, river segments or similar things. It is intuitive to talk
about a graph in which you have airports connected by routes, but the same graph
can be inverted to talk about routes connected by airports. For instance, you
can talk about the Seattle-San Francisco air route (which we can designate as
SEA-SFO) and the San Francisco - Los Angeles route (SFO-LAX). SFO is a
connection (a link) for the SEA-SFO and SFO-LAX routes.

In this respect, routes and airports are both places - they represent specific
states in a hyperspace, and as a consequence, their characteristics can be
identified by the relevant properties for their specializization. An entity that
is on a route domain, for instance, can talk about a location that's addressable
as a distance indicator or time or percentage completed within the context, with
a plane on that route able to determine its address relative to the path.
Addresses do not need to be discrete, though it is frequently useful to do so
especially when dealing with an observation based system.

In the same vein, one can talk about places in street address notation. I have a
house in Seattle, that house has a particular street address that can be
decomposed into a set of related places because of composition, but the address
space here is finite (if fairly large). Again, if the domain is a neighborhood,
then the address space of the house places represents a typically small
hyperspace, the set of all house places within the domain

We tend to nest domain for organizational purposes (and a domain is as much an
organizational structure as it is a physical space). For instance, is I have a
domain of a city that is broken down into separate neighborhoods, the domain
likely tells us nothing about the individual houses in those neighborhoods. You
have to drill into the domain of a given neighborhood to get that level of
information, with the neighborhood places in the city map then acting as
hyperlinks to the respective subdomains.

_Note that this model is somewhat different from other specific geospatial
reference systems, in a few key ways. First is the fact that the address state
space may have different reference coordinate equivalencies (H3,
WGS-84-reference spheroid, relative coordinates and so forth), but these
coordinates are only significant if the topological connections are insufficent.

On a Risk game board, for instance, the hyperspace may be defined relative to a
unit square, with each country then being given an position relative to the
representation of that country's extent on the board. This may affect the user
interface, but from the game's perspective, the position of the corresponding
overlays is material only in that it correlates with the topological
representations not the geometric one.

This approach requires a certain degree of pre-planning. One reason that games
are used as a metaphor is that they often allow for a significant reduction in
the number of dimensions necessarily to capture a model. They also make goal
achievement more feasible, because the agent or thing in the system can identify
a goal and work with the information inherent in the topology rather than trying
to intrinsically capture the specifics of how to achieve these goals.

One additional note - topologies also work in higher dimensions and
non-geospatial contexts. If you have an assembly line, for instance, the actual
position of an object becomes secondary to where it is in terms of station and
process. This is a key point, because once you move into a topological
description of place, you can connect places via workflows (or even talk about
conceptual stations that represent a place where you gain more information or
perform specific actions), without having to deal with physical proximity as
well.

For instance, a physical description of the body can be rendered in one of three
ways: the physical, using a tranverse plane coordinate system, can be helpful
for developing models, but because bodies can be wildly different from
individual to individual, most doctors make use of a taxonomic approach for
describing the various systems - skeletal, musculature, pulminary, vascular,
etc, then using relational maps and juncture points to indicate the specific
connections. This anatomical hyperspace can identify not only location but also
body system, and can be tied into diagnostics and drug pathway interaction
graphs. Similarly, voxel type systems can be used to identify (with CRT
partitioning) specific entities as aggregates of voxels, just as you would use
hex tiling to do the same thing in two dimensions.

This has one other consequence. One of the central challenges in building a
domain is identifying boundaries. Fully contained boundaries can often be
modeled as distinct domains, but even there, the shape of a given space is best
identified by providing either a list of relevant tokens or a perimeter that can
be used to identify containment.

== Landing Places

A landing place is a place within a domain that is used to indicate where a
given agent is placed (lands) when entering a domain without an explicit link to
a place. This can be thought of as the "home" of the domain, and is indicated as
a property of the domain. This corresponds roughly with the #top of an HTML page
when it is rendered. Cf <<domains,Domains>> for more details.

== Entities As Places

Typically links will take you from a place to another place, but it is possible
to link to other entities. Such links will take you to the location of that
entity. For instance, if you wanted to join a party (an
link:aggregations.md[aggregation]), then you could use the SWID of that
aggregation to take you to where that party is located, even if that party moves
around. See <<links,Links>> for more details.


== Summary

Places are a fundamental component of domains, but the two should not be
confused. A domain is a context, a way of organizing information, and because
this is the spatial web, a domain is frequently (but not always) associated with
a place.

ONe of the most important principles of working with places is in the
recognition that topological relationships will likely be more important than
direct geospatial relationships. The exact mechanism to determine how best to
balance these two concerns is still TBD.

[[neighborhoods]]
= Neighborhoods

The __neighborhood__ of a place is the set of all places that can be reached via
links from that place. Note that they do not need to be contiguous (or even in
the same domain), but they do have to be reachable via links. For instance, an
elevator can be thought of as a place that connects multiple rooms, each on
different floors.

    mezzanine
    floor1Hallway
    floor2Hallway
    floor3Hallway
    elevator <--> lobby & mezzanine & floor1Hallway & floor2Hallway & floor3Hallway
----

Here, the lobby, mezzanine, each floor's hallways are all part of the
neighborhood for the elevator.

The specific mechanism for choosing from a set of links is dependent upon the
affordances offered by the reference place (or any entity located at that
reference place). To facilitate this, each link has an optional order property
that is used to indicate the order in which that link is presented.

----
Place:Elevator a Class:Place ;
    Place:hasLink [
        Link:hasPlace Place:Lobby ;
        Link:order 1 ;

    ],
    Place:hasLink [
        Link:hasPlace Place:Floor3Hallway ;
        Link:order 5 ;
    ].
----

Again, it is worth emphasizing here that this is a topologically, rather than
physical, view of a particular space. Each of these places may be in their own
separate closed domains, or they can be part of the same domain, but the effect
is the same - it causes the agent to move through the topological graph of the
places within that domain.
