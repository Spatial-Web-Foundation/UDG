= Spatial embedding of entities

== Spatial embedding technology 

The Spatial Web applies spatial embedding to Spatial Web ENTITIES to create the vector space version of Hyperspace. The Spatial Web defines space as hyperspace in order to represent many entity properties using a spatial embedding approach.   Spatial embedding: mathematical methods for representing data in a continuous, multi-dimensional vector space.

Spatial embedding was a key technology to the recent advances in LLM AI.  A survey of the development of hyperdimensional representation technology presents the main ideas behind the models (<<Kanerva>>).  One of the fundamental papers showed an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships (<<Mikolov>>).  LLMs use spatial embedding for linguistic concepts, encoding words as vectors. The (<<Word2Vec>>) code represents a word as a high-dimension vector of numbers which capture relationships between words. In particular, words which appear in similar contexts are mapped to vectors which are nearby.  

Spatial embedding enables useful functions based on syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.”(<<Mikolov>>)

(<<World2Vec>>) was an internal name for the PyTorch-BigGraph: A Large-scale Graph Embedding System project (<<PBG>>).

Scalability of embedding needs to be assessed for the Spatial Web. (<<Weller>>) showed there are limits of embedding models under a certain vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.



== Cartographic visualization of concept mapping

Spatial embeddings can be visualized using cartographic methods.  (<<BigKnolwedge>>) has developed methods for applying cartographic metaphors and methods for rendering a spatial embedding of non-geographic concepts in to a map-like form.  Vizualization tools can be used for analysis of the conceptual space.  The visualization also serves as a locatting mechanism, e.g., "GPS" for locating knowledge. The visualization requires that the knowledge system works based on a known reference system. This calls for the definition of Hyperspace Reference Systems.

== Hyperspace Reference Systems (HRSs)

Vector emdeddings occur in a vector space.  Vector spaces are indexed using coordinate systems.  The coordinates are the index. 

Defining hypespace vector coordinate systems are essential for interoperability of Hyperspace vector embeddings.  Geographic spatial reference systems can provide the basis for defining Hyperspace Reference System (HRSs). 

Geographic space is indexed using a Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS).  A CRS includes both a Coordinate System (CS) and a Datum.  The CS provides the dimensions and units.  The Datum anchors the abstract CS to the physical world.  Typically a Datum includes a benchmark plate at a specific location to which coordinates are assigned.  The assigned coordinates for that location allow for transformation to a CRS with a different datum.  (See <<ISO_19111_2019, ISO 19111 Referencing by coordinates>>) A coordinate set such as latitude and longitude is ambigous unless a datum is specified.  The GPS positioning system led to the most widely used family of datums known as WGS-84. 

By analogy, investigation is needed to determine if HRSs can be defined for hyperspace coordinates systems using for Spatial Web embedding.  CS systems for spatial embedding already exist.  Datums for Spatial Web hyperspace HRSs are needed. The datums most likely will be based on real-world semantics.  Real-world semantic datums may allow for transformation between HRSs based on differing semantic datums.

With HRSs based on semantic datums defined, Hyperspace Entity Locators (HELs) can be defined. Much like URLs locate based on hypertext, HELs would location an ENTITY ased on an HRS.  HELs would locate ENTITIES in hyperspace.

With HRS and HEL defined, the ability to go from the UDG KG to Hyperspace can be done.  ENTITIES in UDG KG would include an HEL to located it in hyperspace. Thereby providing every KG ENTITY a locating in an HRS; and the locations could be converted between HRSs.

It will be important to define HRSs that are useful across many DOMAINS.
