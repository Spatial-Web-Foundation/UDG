==== Summary Estimate

How big is the UDG?  Estimates of the UDG size are given below.  Here is a summary:

* UDG is a hypergraph which contains all relationships between all known SWIDs in the Spatial Web.
* How many SWIDs might there be in the Spatial Web: approximately 10^14^
** Current large knowledge graphs (Microsoft): is on the order of 10^12^ entities
** Wikipedia is 6*10^7^
** Embedding H3 DGGS into UDG that would be 10^14^ hexagons
* Query performance
** H3 grid/hash queries by Databricks
** Geographic query bigger than a set of buildings in the US is too big. 2.5*10^8^

==== Existing large knowledge graphs

The UDG is similar to existing, proprietary knowledge graphs.

https://cacm.acm.org/practice/industry-scale-knowledge-graphs/[Industry-Scale Knowledge Graphs in ACM Communications 2019]
provides a summary of large existing knowledge graphs.  These knowledge graphs
may have grown a handful of orders of magnitude since 2019 when the size of each
was:

* Microsoftâ€™s knowledge graph:  approximately 2 billion primary entities,  2*10^9^ entities as of 2019.
* 2023 estimate of large knowledge graphs 10^12^ entities


As of September 2025, the contents of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia[Wikipedia] were:

* English articles 7,063,252 (roughly 7*10^7^)
* Total wiki pages: 64,128,394



==== Geographic H3 index

The H3 geospatial indexing system is a discrete global grid system (see Sahr et al., 2003) consisting of a multi-precision hexagonal tiling of the sphere with hierarchical indexes.   H3 was developed to address the challenges of Uber's data science needs. H3 is now open source under the Apache 2 license.

H3 is a hierarchical geospatial index. Hexagonal cells at level 12 have an area of 90 dm2 and there are 5.7*10^14^ hexagons


==== VERSES estimate of the Spatial Web

* 2.4 trillion objects on the Earth.  2.4*10^12^
* 9.9 sextillion connections on the internet 9.9*10^21^
* 2.9 septillion connections on the spatial web 2.9*10^24^
* Square root of a septillion = approximately 10^12^
