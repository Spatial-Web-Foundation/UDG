The UDG is a publicly accessible information commons that serves as a key infrastructure component of the Spatial Web. The UDG is a medium for collective intelligence in the Spatial Web. As a data commons it provides public access to information about the world. The information in the UDG allows for a previously unavailable representation of the physical and conceptual aspects of existence. The UDG will be populated by observations from sensors and semantic statements from cognitive agents. The UDG provides the solution for the grounding problem faced by Artificial Intelligence Agents.  Improved reasoning by both artificial and natural intelligence will result in improved decisions for humanity's future. 

The UDG provides an open, accessible representation of all ENTITIES. It enables efficient and accurate modeling and analysis of domain relationships. It allows for the organization of domains into an architecture that maintains intra-relational and inter-relational domain coherence, allowing for the coordination and integration of domain-specific data and content. The UDG allows for nested, hierarchical and heterarchical searches and transformations within and across domains.

The UDG leverages the following concepts:

* **UDG Knowledge Graph (KG)** is the hypergraph containing all relationships between all known Spatial Web conceptual ENTITIES. The UDG KG is composed of nodes and links where the nodes are ENTITIES and the links are relations between the ENTITIES. Each Spatial Web ENTITY has a Spatial Web Identifier (SWID).  The UDG KG is defined in <<section-conceptual-view-knowldge-graph>>
* **UDG Hyperspace** is the representation of UDG relationship using the several types of Spatial Web Hyperspace including Graphs, Cellular spaces with cell identifiers, and Vector spaces with coordinates.  The different types of Hyperspace allow for different methods for navigating and discoverying ENTITIES.  These concpets along with the relationshps between UDG in differing hyperspaces are defined in <<section-conceptual-view-hyperspace>>
* **UDG Registries** are a coordinated set of hierarchically organized registeries of DOMAINS.  Top-level DOMAINs are registered in the Spatial Web Designated Authority Registry.  Top-level domains may link to a domain-specific registry.  The sysgtem of UDG Registries are defined in  <<section-conceptual-registry>>
* **UDG Social Networks** is the communication between ENTITIES in the UDG.  In particular AGENTS will gather information about the state of the environment from other ENTITIES in the UDG.  AGENTS will exchange information with other AGENTS to form beliefs about the environment. Neighborhoods in the UDG will affect the social engagement between AGENTS. This communication between AGENTS is a social epistemological process leading to collective intelligence as described in the <<section-conceputal-view-social-network>>
* **Distributed UDG System** is the set of coordinated Spatial Web Nodes that provide services on the distributed UDG.  A Spatial Web Node is a computing machine connected to the internet, capable of exchanging HSTP messages.  Spatial Web Nodes particular to the UDG include: UDG Nodes and Registry Nodes.  The UDG Node peforms functions related to the distributed communications needed for UDG functions, e.g., state propogation and distributed queries.  UDG Registry Nodes implement UDG Registry functions.  These topics are discussed in the <<section-distributed-computing>>


The UDG conceptual structures (KG, Hyperspace, Registries, Social network) are implemented in the Spatial Web Nodes of the distributed UDG System. There is a non-isomorphic relationship between the conceptual domain hierarchies and the SW Nodes. Presence of a Domain in a specific SW node may be dynamic and transient. This relationship between the conceptual views and the Distributed Computing view is represented in <<fig-udg-enterprise>> 

Each viewpoint of the UDG includes requirements that are specific to Spatial Web Components. Implementations of the Spatial Web UDG design are achieved by allocating requirements across those components. The <<annex-requirements-allocation>> gathers the requirements for each component. The Spatial Web Components used in this UDG Design specification are:

* Hyperspace Modeling Language (HSML) (SWF STD-02) 
* Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol (HSTP) (SWF STD-03) 
* SWID Documents (SWF STD-04) 
* Spatial Web DID method (SWF STD-05) 
* Spatial Web Registry  
* UDG Node Design  
* Agent Verification plan 
* Spatial Web Governance
