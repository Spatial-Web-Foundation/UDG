= Idea flow in social networks

== Social intelligence 

Groups have a collective intelligence that is mostly independent of the intelligence of the individual participants.  The UDG a universal digital commons is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills.

The UDG is a social network of ENTITIES in the Spatial Web.  In particular AGENTS will interact with other ENTITIES including other AGENTS to determine the state of the environment, to determine knowledge about other ENTITES, to
coordinate ACTIVITIES.  The structure of relationships in the UDG Social viewpoint are in many cases more important than the knowledge content of ENTITES in the UDG KG.

Social intelligence is composed of individual intelligence, but social intelligence quality is distinct from individuals ideas.  Social intelligence is necessary as individual intelligence is more limited.

"The knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess   <<Hayek_1945>>.""

The design approach for social intelligence in the UDG does not guarantee results or solutions to all problems, but it creates an institutional infrastructure that unleashes more local knowledge and individual initiative, and therefore does in fact produce better results and more solutions.

The UDG employs social networks to improve idea flow between AGENTS. Social physics provides the science for the design.  The design choices take into account social issues like autonomy, privacy, self-determination. These design choices are crtical to avoid creating a virtual Panopticon.


== Social idea flow

Idea flow is the engagement and belief propagation which spreads new behaviors through a social network. Idea flow may be conceptualized as exploration to harvest new ideas followed by engagement with peers to sift through those ideas and convert the good ideas into habits.

Social physics is a quantitative social science that describes reliable, mathematical connections between information and idea flow on the one hand and people’s behavior on the other <<Pentland_2015>>. Social physics seeks to understand how the flow of ideas and information translates into changes in behavior. It provides a causal theory of how social structures confer evolutionary advantage. An alternative term for social physics is computational social science.

One aspect of idea flow that by pooling ideas, we can get an average "wisdom of the crowd" a judgment that will be better than individual AGENT judgements and decisions. The effectiveness of idea-pooling for estimation problems works as long as there is no initial social interaction. It assumes that all the people in the crowd will act independently. When social interaction occurs, AGENTS begin influencing other AGENTS, and that may result in panics, bubbles, and fads.   In humans, the social learning strategy of feeding back the best current idea—that is, a constrained, artificial sort of social interaction that interleaves periods of idea harvesting with periods when experts evaluate the ideas—produces a wisdom of the crowd effect that works even for small groups. This can be effective in the Spatial Web as well.

Social Learning is measure of idea flow. It is the chance that a person's behavior will change when a new idea has appeared in their extended social network. 

Exploration refers to the use of social networks in harvesting ideas and information. Exploration is the part of idea flow that brings new ideas into a work group or community. Social learning, Diversity and Contrarians are important for effectie exploration.

In order to acheive Enagement in the UDG, AGENTS must interact, cooperate and build trust.

One measure of effectiveness of idea flow is creativity. Creative output depends strongly on two processes: idea discovery (exploration) and the integration of those ideas into new behaviors (engagement).  Exploration outside of the group, together with their engagement within the group. Exploration and Engagement networks are shown in <<exploration-engagement-networks>>. 

The UDG and AGENTS are designed to improve Idea Flow.  With increased engagement comes an increase in opportunities for social learning, for sharing vital resources such as tacit operational knowledge and successful work habits. Thois results in improved collective intelligence peformance. Collective intelligence is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and for human groups, the proportion of females in the group. <<woolley_2010>>

== The Mathematics of Social Influence

An “influence model” can assit in understanding social influence.  The model estimates how much the state of one AGENT  affects the state of another AGENT in the Spatial Web. The model can recover estimates of influence, generate results that are consistent with other measures of social networks, and uncovers important shifts in the way states may be transmitted between actors at different points in time. <<Pan_et_al_2013>>

This model takes raw observations of behavior and provides social network parameters needed to get a numerical estimate of idea flow, which is the proportion of users who are likely to adopt a new idea introduced into the social network. 

Idea flow takes into account all the elements of the influence model: network structure, social influence strength, and individual susceptibility to new ideas.

The influence model allows for examination of social roles:  protagonist, attacker, supporter, neutral, and so on, in small groups, and in organizations, 

	

== Networks, Groups, and Organizations

Networks are a set of relationships connecting individual AGENTS, organization DOMAIN, or groups of AGENTS and/or Organizational DOMAINS (perhaps modeled as a DOMAIN)

Networks can come in multiple forms:
 
* Primary groups: Small, intimate groups that are central to an individual's identity and provide emotional and intellectual support. Examples: Family, close friends, and long-term work or church groups. Characteristics: Long-term and emotionally vital. 
* Secondary groups:  Larger, more impersonal groups that are often formed for a specific purpose or goal.   Examples: A class, a workplace team, or a large organization. Characteristics: Often temporary and task-oriented.
* Formal organizations:  Large, structured groups that are designed to achieve specific objectives.  Characteristics: Usually have a hierarchy, a professional leadership, and written records. 
* Informal organizations: Looser, less structured groups that emerge within formal organizations, such as social friendships between coworkers. 
* Bureaucracy: A formal system of organization characterized by a clear hierarchy, division of labor, and rules.
