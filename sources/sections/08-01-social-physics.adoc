== Social networks

The UDG is a social network of ENTITIES in the Spatial Web.  In particular
AGENTS will interact with other ENTITIES including other AGENTS to determine the
state of the environment, to determine knowledge about other ENTITES, to
coordinate ACTIVITIES.  The structure of links in the UDG Social viewpoint are
in many cases more important than the knowledge content of ENTITES in the UDG
KG.

** Network epistemology: how social network structure affects beliefs and knowledge
** Some epistemic problems are caused by social structure, not by individually bad behavior.
*** Group pathologies, like pluralistic ignorance, herding, and polarization,
** Agents have an incentive to gain more information either by learning too fast or by adopting best-learning even when it would be good for the group that they "refrain from doing so".
** Independence Thesis: norms of social epistemology are independent of norms of individual epistemology.
