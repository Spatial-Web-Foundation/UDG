== UDG as a social network

=== Social networks

The UDG is a social network of ENTITIES in the Spatial Web.  In particular AGENTS will interact with other ENTITIES including other AGENTS to determine the state of the environment, to determine knowledge about other ENTITES, to coordinate ACTIVITIES.  The structure of links in the UDG Social viewpoint are in many cases more important than the knowledge content of ENTITES in the UDG KG.

-- Agents have an incentive to gain more information either by learning too fast or by adopting best-learning even when it would be good for the group that the’refrain from doing so.’
