. UDG shall enable discovery of physical and virtual entities via discovery services. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[5.2.3.3.2]

** *This is a multipart problem. Public entities will be identified within a set of spatial web registries, broken down by category, location, or similar systems. **(Entity Registries)**. Individual SW Nodes (SWNodes) may reference these entities, and may also annotate them. Entity annotations are only available if users have the relevant access to these separate SWNodes).  Cf. **Annotations**.*

. UDG shall validate SWIDs generated using SWID Method prior to issuance, e.g., assess uniqueness. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.3.3.4]

** *Any SWNode may generate SWID nodes (typically following a specific syntax) that includes a UUID identifier component. cf. **UDG SWIDS***

. UDG shall include a Spatial Web registration service for Public and Top domains. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.3.3.4]

** *All public and top domains will be part of the **Entity Registries,** which are specfic SWNodes that incorporate registration services. Private entities and domains are issued through the respective SWNode, but are not necessarily registered.*

. UDG shall, for audit purposes, register all SWIDs related to all public and top domains in a Spatial Web Registry. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.3.3.4]

** In general, the responsibility for the consistency of the graph within a SWNode will reside primarily for the host of the node, though certainly the UDG specification will offer mechanisms to test and compare entity representation between nodes. See **UDG and HSTP**

. UDG shall provide for distributed operations of the UDG including propagation of changes and consistency. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.3.5.3]

. UDG design and procedures shall enable a range of methods for accessing the UDG from basic, open access to UDG access services with enhanced value in accord with economic exchange, e.g, fee, advertising, etc. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.3.5.3]

** UDG makes use of a role based ACL system that enables multiple levels of access and interface visibility See **Agents, Security and Credentials**

. UDG shall provide the capability to register and manage ACTIVITIES that are associated with AGENTs, reflecting their capabilities and permissions. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.4.4.8]

** ACTIVITIES are defined with respect to roles, and have their own specific SWID identifiers. A CONTRACT is a specific entity that identifies a AGENT ROLE with an associated binding to the relevant PERSON to perform an ACTIVITY. When the CONTRACT is executed, a REPORT is created and persisted indicating the outcome of the contract. See **UDG Activities**.

. UDG shall keep a record of HSML ACTIVITIES that were executed as part of a Contract, providing a history of the Activity, verification of the execution of the Activity, and enabling the tracking of the Activity’s progress. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[6.4.4.8]

** See **UDG Activities**

. UDG shall be designed to operate with communication network performance where bandwidth ranging from hundreds of gigabits per second to several terabits per second (i.e. having latency in the sub-millisecond range). Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.1.3]

** This is implementation specific and is outside the scope or purview of this project. See **UDG State Management**.

. UDG shall provide mechanisms for automatic discovery of nodes, and their properties and capabilities as well as the means to access them. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.1.3]

** The master Node Registry contains a primary list to registered nodes in the Spatial Web Network. Each Node also contains a cache of existing nodes as node records within the UDG graph that can also include subdomain nodes that are not formally registered. These follow the same credentialling mechanism. See **Node Registry**

. UDG shall support the ability to accommodate an increasing number of connectivity endpoints, reaching internet scale. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.1.3]

** See **Node Registry**.

. UDG shall include Spatial Index Servers that make maps ranging from simple SQL indexes to graph-based databases to widely adopted and standard spatial indexing services which deliver spatial indexing. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.2.2]

** The UDG supports a mechanism to specific the characteristics of a given **Hyperspace** through the Unit interface, with publicly available Units contained in the Unit Registry. This includes mechanisms for linking to external servers for resolution of indexed-based hyperspace metrics (see **External Services**). The Place Registry ****is an **Entity Registry** that provides Atlas and Gazeteer functionality.

. UDG shall manage entity replication and update with consideration of how quickly the entities are changing. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.2.2]

** Entities are created, modified, and deprecated through the HSTP interfaces (entities in general are not replicated). This process is covered in **UDG and HSTP**. Note that the latency of the Spatial Web System will be a function of the implementation of that system on any given node, and as such is out of scope of this particular project.

. UDG shall manage rapidly changing entities using a peer-to-peer methodology between Spatial Severs, managed by cloud instance(s), but bound by spatial CONTRACTs stored in a DLT Spatial Domain. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.2.2]

** As with #21, the specific latency of a given system will be a fairly complex function of graph speed, network latency, complexity of queries, processor throughput and so forth, and as such is out of scope of this particular specification (see **UDG and HSTP** for details about these issues). Private entities that “move” between different servers (such as a character moving from one game-world to another) will use HSTP to communicate the state change, with the old entity being deprecated and a new entity with associated metadata being created from one system to another. See **Entity and Domain Transfer**.

. UDG shall manage slow-changing cross-ledger entities and CONTRACTs on a distributed ledger. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.2.2]

** See **Entity and Domain Transfer**. Please note, in general, no information is lost on a given node, it is only deprecated or deactivated.

. UDG System may incur latency when achieving consensus. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.2.2]

** In general, credentials will be cached on each SWNode within a separate secured graph on that node (not part of the domain graph) in order to significantly reduce latency. See **Security and Credentials**.

. UDG shall implement the use cases: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.4.4], and https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.4.11]. Source: https://www.notion.so/IEEE-UDG-Requirements-1fa40ac3a1e8802cbca5f503e627a391?pvs=21[7.4.2]

** All domains make use of an update process that takes a parametric bundle (with credentials but without specific identifiers) and maps them to an HSML structure stored within the graph cf. **UDG and HSTP**) . This bundle will vary from domain to domain, which means that there is a discovery mechanism in place that provides the requisite properties as a JSON encoded SHACL file. This process will then generate the relevant subgraphs in the UDG Node and return a REPORT containing the node identifier and displayable information for that domain or entity. See **Representations**
