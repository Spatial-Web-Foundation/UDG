= Hierarchical domain registries


== Domain-specific registries

Domain Authorities may establish a domain-specific registry.  A domain-specific registry may the same functions as the Spatial Web Registry (creation of did:swids and registering membership of domains).  The difference is the scope of a domain-specific registry is for a specific domain where as the Spatial Web Registry is the registry for all registered DOMAINS.  


== Domain Authority role

The Domain Authority plays five roles simultaneously in the Spatial Web:

* As a Domain Authority (DA), it governs related subdomains, controls its Domain Governance, and may issue and govern SWIDs.
* As Registrant, it registers its Domain
* As a Registry, it maintains all subdomains under its Domain,
* As a Registrar, it issues SWIDs for products, operations, personnel, agents, geolocations, etc.
* As an Index, it organizes and makes domain-related information discoverable in the UDG.



== Registry of Registries

A domain-specific registry may be registered in the Spatial Web Registry.  As this registration may propogate through several layers of domain hiearchy, a hiearchy of registries is created.
