== UDG Distributed Computing

=== Overview

Computing Continuum and Spatial Web Nodes. 
Overall architecture of the spatial web node system, which involves both communication across HSTP protocols (query/response) as well as joining nodes together to create ad-hoc super nodes (i.e., spatial web federation).
Structure of the Spatial Web Node, including the primary hstp.d and hsml.d daemons, the domain graph, a credential graph, and a schema graph.
Bridging HSTP and UDG scopes (handled through hstp.d and hsml.d respectively)
Managing internal local hstp.d clocks (repeating internal events) to manage query and updates against live resources.
Place, Person, Thing and SW Node registry for commonly referenced entities (the Spatial Web registry)
