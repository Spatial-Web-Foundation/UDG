== Overview

=== Scope

This report describes the preliminary approach for the Spatial Web UDG System Design Specification.  (In IEEE 2874-2025 this document was titled the UDG Implmentation Specification.)

=== Purpose

The purpose of this report is to present the results of a trade study on technology and research that is relevant to a Spatial Web UDG Design.   The report was prepared as part of the Spatial Web Foundation Preliminary Design activities.

=== Structure of document

As a trade study the report addresses these themes:

- Identification of requirements and fundamental design questions
- Survey and assessment of relevant, existing technology and research
- Draft Design for UDG System:  Foundations, Conceptual Models, Distributed Computing

This document is structured as a reference model consistent with the approach defined in <<ISO_IEC_IEEE_42010_2022>>. This reference model provides concepts to subsequently define Spatial Web Implementation standards and to guide domain-specific Spatial Web architecture developments.

This document provides five viewpoints of the UDG.  These five viewpoints comprise the UDG System Design

=== Conventions used in this standard

In this document the following Spatial Web ontology entries (ENTITY, ACTIVITY, AGENT, CONTRACT, CHANNEL, CREDENTIAL, DOMAIN, HYPERSPACE, and TIME) are represented using uppercase.
