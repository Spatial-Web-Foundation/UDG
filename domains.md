# Domains
 
> A __domain__ is a closed system, or graph, that contains various entities and that can be linked to other domains.

A domain can be thought of as a system of concern. Because domains frequently are associated with places, the two are often conflated, but they serve different purposes. A place is one particular state within a hyperspace of such states, while the domain is typically associated with a place in another domain. The place is an entity, the domain is the system referred to by the entity and containing other entities. As such it can be thought of as a bounding space for closed models.

Significantly, a single entity may have multiple associated internal domains. For example, if Place: Planet:Earth is a Place, one domain may be the domain of countries on the Earth, the second, the domain of airports and routes, a third domain may be the supply chain network for a specific global company.

 Such domains can be thought of as overlays on the same place (or other entity) resource. For instance, for a given building, one domain overlay shows the rooms of that building along with their occupants, a second shows the electrical system for that building, the third the plumbing system, and the fourth, an augemented reality reference of interesting things that happened historically within that building.

 Typically places connect (via links) to other places, but such links can exist between the same place in different domains. For instance, the electrical, plumbing, walls, and tenancy domains might let you switch between each view of the same room in effect by moving to the same place in each domain. 
 
 Similarly, if you are standing in a town square, you can iterate through domains over time to see the evolution of that town square over hundreds of years.
