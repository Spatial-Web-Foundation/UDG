# UDG SWIDs

## UDG and SWIDs

All resources within th Universal Domain Graph have some form of a __Spatial Web Identifier__ also known as a __SWID__. The SWID serves a number of purposes:

* A SWID is a __W3C Decentralized Identifier__ (__DiD__), and is used as a mechanism to make claims (assertions) about specific facts with a form of verification backing up those claims. This is known as a __Verifiable Credential__ or (__VC__).
* The SWID identifies the resource uniquely within the spatial web network. In this regard, the SWID acts as an (indirect) IRI.
* SWIDs are also used to establish links between resources. Because the VC for the SWID can hold multiple potential values, such links typically are used to combine SW Node information with Domain and Entity resolution.
* SWIDs are also likely used to resolve __nodelink__ connections between different nodes in the SW Node Graph, making it possible to bind together nodes in networks.
* Finally SWIDs are used to ascertain
